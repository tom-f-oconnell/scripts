- maybe move movein stuff to dotfiles install? just call it?

- possible to make hotkey that works in browsers, to copy stack overflow links
  without the slug at the end?

- breakout automatic postmortem implementation (+ modifications to errors) to
  package (`pymistake`)

  - modify color of ipdb prompt + that initial ipdb prints from default green
    to maybe a red, to make it immediately obvious whether it was an uncaught
    error or a manually set ipdb breakpoint

- wrap below two somehow to make a script to test whether something came
  preinstalled (for only using preinstalled stuff when i want to be 
  compatible w/ stock distributions)

  (from: https://askubuntu.com/questions/481 )
  dpkg -S <file>
  (-> package)

  (from: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1192110 )
  apt autoremove <package> --simulate | grep ubuntu-desktop
  (may just need to test if output is empty)
